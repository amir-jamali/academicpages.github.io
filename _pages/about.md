I am Amir Jamali. I am a graduate student at Concordia University, working on computer vision, deep learning, and cybersecurity. I received my Bachelor of Science in electronics from K. N. Toosi University of Technology in 2006. I had worked as an electronics engineer to design the power supply for radio FM transmitters after my graduation. In 2012, I started my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at Amirkabir University of Technology(Tehran Polytechnic), where I did my research in the fields of machine learning, image processing, and 3D computer vision. My M.Sc. thesis title was "Sparse and Dense 3D Face Modelling based on 2.5D AAM Approach from a Single Image". You can see a brief review of my thesis [Here](https://amir-jamali.github.io/files/Msc_Thesis.pdf).I have been working in the computer vision industry since 2014, where it not only enhances my knowledge and skills in this field but also it teaches me how I should handle real-world machine learning challenges. A brief review of projects is available [Here](https://amir-jamali.github.io/files/Professional_Project.pdf).
